$ npm run dev
```

This project includes all of Rise Kit and works inside Rise Playground out of the box. To learn more, [check out our docs!](https://rise.tools/docs/playground/#building-for-playground).

It showcases features of Rise Playground, including interactions, event handling and more. You can use it as a starting point for your own projects.

If you prefer to start from scratch, you can use the [`blank-playground`](../blank-playground/) template instead.
