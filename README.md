- Modular Data Sources - use the [included TypeScript server](https://rise.tools/docs/server-js/), or [bring your own](https://rise.tools/docs/server-spec/)
- Custom Component Suites - use the [Rise Kit](https://rise.tools/docs/kit) and [Tamagui](https://rise.tools/docs/kit/tamagui), or [use your own components](https://rise.tools/docs/guides/custom-components)
- References - [Components can refer to other data keys](https://rise.tools/docs/guides/refs).
