# Rise Playground App

<PlaygroundAppDownload />

The Rise app allows the user to specify different "connections", which are WebSocket URLs that will define their UI.

## Building for Playground

The playground supports all of [Rise Kit](/docs/kit), which allows you to quickly build a UI for testing on your device.

> Note: The Playground app uses [React Navigation](/docs/kit/react-navigation), so the Expo Router kit is not available.

## Open Source

Of course the [Playground code is Open Source](https://github.com/rise-tools/rise-tools/tree/main/apps/mobile) under the same [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/rise-tools/rise-tools/blob/main/LICENSE) as the rest of the project.

You can use the Playground code to distribute your own whitelabel app, or you can use it as inspiration for your own project.
