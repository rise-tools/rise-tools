# kit-qrcode

```sh
npm install @rise-tools/kit-qrcode react-native-qrcode-svg react-native-svg
```

You must also configure `react-native-svg` in your project. If you're using Expo, run:
```sh
npx expo install react-native-svg
```

If you have already configured `@rise-tools/kit-svg`, you can skip this step.
