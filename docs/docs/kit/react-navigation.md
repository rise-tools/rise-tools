# kit-react-navigation

## Client Installation

First make sure you are set up with React Navigation. If not, follow [this guide](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started). Then install the kit adapter:

```sh
npm install @rise-tools/kit-react-navigation 
```

You will need a "wildcard" route that will be used for your server-defined screens.
