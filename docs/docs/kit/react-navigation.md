# kit-react-navigation

## Client Installation

First make sure you are set up with React Navigation. If not, follow [this guide](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started). Then install the kit adapter:

```sh
npm install @rise-tools/kit-react-navigation 
```

> This doc is still a Work-in-Progress. Your help would be appreciated in completing it.

You will need a "wildcard" route that will be used for your server-defined screens.

To see an example client implementation that uses React Navigation, see the [source code of the playground app](https://github.com/rise-tools/rise-tools/tree/main/apps/mobile). (Keep in mind this is more complicated than usual because it supports connections to many Rise Servers.)
