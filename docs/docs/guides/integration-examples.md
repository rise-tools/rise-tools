# Integration Examples

There are many ways to integrate Rise into an existing app.

## Standalone Components

When you have a small component that can change in production, you may wish to use the Rise component. You can also use the Rise component as an invisible placeholder for an optional component that will appear later in production once your server endpoint is installed.

## Full Screen

You may use the Rise Component as a full screen of your app.

## Navigation

You may navigate to a single route which handles arbitrary full-screen pages of your app. This is a useful integration because it allows your Server-Defined Components to navigate to new pages which are not determined at the time you ship your app to production.

See the [navigation guide](/docs/guides/navigation) for more details, or reference the [React Native starter app](https://github.com/rise-tools/rise-mobile-quickstart) to see how this works with Expo Router.
